# Java-OOP-GUI
I worked with a group to design, implement, and test an object oriented bus ticket program in Java with an interactive GUI. 
## System Requirements
We started with designing the overall structure of our program. We drafted a list of users and use cases for those users. This information was used to build a use case diagram. Datailed used case descriptions for each bubble in the diagram were also included in the [final report](<Design Documents/Final_Report.pdf>).

## Domain Class Model
With the use case diagram, we determined the classes that our program would use. We created a [domain class model](<Design Documents/domain_class_model.JPG>) to depict the interactions between classes. OOP principles such as inheritance were also used to improve the overall design.

## UML Diagrams
Using the domian class model, our next step was to create UML diagrams for each class in our project. These diagrams showed the visibility, attributes, and methods for all of our classes. An example UML diagram for the Passenger class is shown below, with all diagrams included in the [final report](<Design Documents/Final_Report.pdf>).

## State Diagram
Finally, we created a [state diagram](<Design Documents/state_diagram.JPG>) for our system to show each step of the process as a user buys a bus ticket.

## Implementation and Testing
After the design work we were ready to begin coding.
